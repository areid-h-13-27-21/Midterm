### Purpose
We are attempting to improve the Math Peer Tutoring program at GA by making their organization of student mentors and mentees easier. We do this by finding pairs with coordinating free blocks and tutors who have taken that math class, or a higher level or that math class, in the past, and are able to help their peers.
